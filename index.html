	<h2> <strong> Guiding the soul to victory</strong> : There is no quantitative measure for a true hero.</h2>
	<p>
	Two crowned Kings, and One that stood alone </br>
	With no green weight of laurels round his head, </br>
	But with sad eyes as one uncomforted, </br>
	And wearied with man's never-ceasing moan </br>
	For sins no bleating victim can atone, </br>
	And sweet long lips with tears and kisses fed. </br>
	Girt was he in a garment black and red, </br>
	And at his feet I marked a broken stone </br>
	Which sent up lilies, dove-like, to his knees. </br>
	Now at their sight, my heart being lit with flame, </br>
	I cried to Beatrice, 'Who are these? ' </br>
	And she made answer, knowing well each name, </br>
	'AEschylos first, the second Sophokles, </br>
	And last (wide stream of tears!) Euripides.'  </br>
